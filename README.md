# Repo for my thesis
This project aims to develop and test an autonomous framework for antenna deployment in a VR/AR simulation environment using reinforcement learning (RL) to learn deployment strategies based on human operators and an LLM to assist in reasoning and task planning. This research aims to determine if RL can learn antenna deployment strategies effectively. It also aims to measure the effectiveness of an LLMâ€™s ability to reason over tasks autonomously and handle complex situations according to a set of a-priori mission objectives.

## What should I look at?
If you look at any code, know that it is messy and very much a work in progress. Autonomy stuff can be found in autonomy_bc. Unity_moveit_bridge contains stuff for sending data to and from unity
